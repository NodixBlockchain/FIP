1) Has the kitty's energy level changed?
2) How have the kitty’s eating and drinking habits been?
3) Have the kitty’s litterbox habits changed at all? Any diarrhea or constipation? Are they urinating a lot or not enough? Any accidents?
4) Are the kitty's eyes cloudy at all? Are their 3rd eyelids visible? Do the pupils at all appear to be different sizes (look closely)? If yes to either question, please include a picture of their eyes - please take as few pictures facing them in good lighting with no flash.
5) When your kitty walks, are they "wobbly"? Do they seem to lose their balance and/or fall over when walking?
6) Has the kitty had a fever? If yes, what was their temperature? What is their current temperature? How long have they had a fever (if known)?
7) Is the kitty currently taking any medications? If so, please provide the drug name and dosage of each.
8) Include results from any lab/xray/ultrasound/testing of abdominal/chest cavity fluid (if present). If you do not have them yet, just say that. Then please ask your vet for copies of results for any tests that were run and post them in this comment thread whenever you do get them. In order to prevent confusion and duplicate work efforts, please do not make another new, separate post for just the test results.
9) Your location (city/state/country)
10) The kitty's name and age
11) The kitty's weight (please be as exact as possible)
